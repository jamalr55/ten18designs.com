            <p>
              Hi my name is Jamal Richardson and I'm a designer to the core. I
              started as a freelance designer in 2009 in Houston, Texas. Since
              then I have had a bountiful career in design. I specialized as a
              freelance graphic designer and web developer sense 2009. Never
              being formally employed, I have had the honor to work with several
              company's in the Houston area. I first got into Graphic Design and
              Multimedia when I was in high school, I took a Graphic Arts class
              and liked creating art with computer programs.
              <br />
              I have an Associate of Applied Science in Graphic Design and
              Multimedia from Westwood College. I have a passion for design and
              the graphic arts. My parents bought me a computer when I was 18, a
              friend lent me a copy of Photoshop CS1 and I have been doing it
              ever since picking up new skills along the way.

              seeking steady employment, but we also know that he should have no
